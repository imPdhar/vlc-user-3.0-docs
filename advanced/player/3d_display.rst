 3D Display with VLC
#####################

3D display is a process of projecting the depth perception of a media file using different methods. 
They are:

* :guilabel:`Anaglyph` - Red/Green or Red/Blue images with colours filtering out each other using Glasses.
* :guilabel:`Polarization` - Polarization glasses are used to restrict entering of light through each eye perceiving an image with depth. 
* :guilabel:`Active Shutter` - Uses alternating images for each eye to create the 3D effect.
* :guilabel:`Autostereoscopy` - AKA Glass-free 3D, is a method of displaying 3D Media by adding binocular perception to the rendered image. 

Out of these, VLC 3.0 supports **Side-by-Side Anaglyph** Videos.
